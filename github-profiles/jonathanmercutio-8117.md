# Hi there üëã My name is Jonathan Herrera, current I¬¥m in Colombia. 

As a **software** dreamer and doer üéÜ, I excel at turning ideas into reality with agile methodologies like **SCRUM**. With a keen eye for managing teams and overcoming roadblocks, I bring deep knowledge of software development to every project I touch. 

My passion for **technology** started at a young age, and I quickly became a self-taught web developer, creating websites for friends and family. Fast forward to today, and I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer and a Jedi Knight üòè, using my **skills** to build cutting-edge solutions and conquer the galaxy (well, maybe just the tech world for now). Let's talk about how I can bring my experience and creativity to your team!
