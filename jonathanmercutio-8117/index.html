    <H1>Hi there üëã My name is Jonathan Herrera, current I¬¥m in Colombia.</H1>> 

    As a <strong>software</strong> dreamer and doer üéÜ, I excel at turning ideas into reality with agile methodologies like <strong>SCRUM</strong>. With a keen eye for managing teams and overcoming roadblocks, I bring deep knowledge of software development to every project I touch. 

    My passion for <strong>technology</strong> started at a young age, and I quickly became a self-taught web developer, creating websites for friends and family. Fast forward to today, and I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer and a Jedi Knight üòè, using my <strong>skills</strong> to build cutting-edge solutions and conquer the galaxy (well, maybe just the tech world for now). Let's talk about how I can bring my experience and creativity to your team!
